   - Purpose: Learn human preferences

8. **Multilingual Training Data**
   - Value: $0.30-0.50 per pair
   - Buyers: Google, DeepL, Meta
   - Purpose: Improve translation capabilities

## üìä How It Works

### Device Connection Flow
1. User visits `/compute-network` page
2. Clicks "Connect This Device"
3. Device capabilities are automatically detected
4. WebRTC connection established with network
5. Device joins pool and starts earning

### Task Processing Flow
1. Community votes on preferred tasks
2. Tasks are distributed based on device capabilities
3. Users complete tasks (answer questions, verify data, etc.)
4. Results are validated through consensus
5. Rewards distributed instantly

### Multi-Device Sync
1. Open WE1WEB on primary device
2. Generate sync code or QR
3. Enter code on secondary devices
4. Devices connect via WebRTC
5. Combined resources shown in dashboard

## üí∞ Revenue Model Explained

### Why Companies Pay for This Data

**OpenAI/Anthropic Need:**
- Human feedback to improve model responses
- Edge cases to fix model failures
- Diverse conversations for training
- Safety testing scenarios

**What Users Provide:**
- Preference rankings between AI outputs
- Verification of factual claims
- Description of images/videos
- Code quality assessments
- Translation verification

**Value Creation:**
- 1000 human feedback tasks = $150-250 to companies
- Users earn $50-200/month for idle device time
- Network takes 20% platform fee
- Win-win for everyone

## üîß Technical Implementation

### WebRTC P2P Architecture
```typescript
// Devices connect directly to each other
const rtcConfig = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'turn:relay.we1web.com:3478' }
  ]
};

// Data channels for task coordination
const dataChannel = pc.createDataChannel('tasks', {
  ordered: true,
  maxRetransmits: 3
});
```

### Bandwidth Optimization
- **Compression**: Reduces data transfer by 60%
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate processing
- **Smart Routing**: Direct, relay, or mesh based on network
- **Adaptive Quality**: Adjusts based on connection speed

### Device Detection
```typescript
// Automatic capability detection
const capabilities = {
  cpu: navigator.hardwareConcurrency,
  memory: navigator.deviceMemory,
  gpu: detectWebGLCapabilities(),
  network: await measureBandwidth()
};
```

## üéØ Benefits for AI Models (Like Claude)
