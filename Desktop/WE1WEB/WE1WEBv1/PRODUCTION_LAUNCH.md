## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

**CRITICAL: The app won't fully function until you add these in Vercel:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/we1web/we1web/settings/environment-variables
2. Add these variables:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<your_service_key>
   JWT_SECRET=<generate_strong_secret>
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret>
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your_stripe_public_key>
   ```

### 2. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Create project at https://app.supabase.com
2. Run migrations from `/supabase/migrations/`
3. Enable Row Level Security
4. Configure authentication providers

### 3. Configure Custom Domain

When you own we1web.com:
```bash
# Add domain to Vercel
vercel domains add we1web.com

# Configure DNS:
A     @      76.76.21.21
CNAME www    cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 4. Set Up Monitoring

1. **Error Tracking:** Already integrated in `/lib/error-tracking.ts`
2. **Analytics:** Add Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics
3. **Uptime Monitoring:** Use Vercel's built-in monitoring
4. **Performance:** Check Core Web Vitals in Vercel dashboard
