## 🌍 The Vision That Changes Everything

**WE1WEB** is building the **world's largest decentralized living neural network** powered by personal devices for AI infrastructure, giving all control to humanity and coexisting with AI, solving the AI alignment threat by being its brain, leveraging existing hardware that is increasingly more powerful, saving billions of dollars in new energy-hungry data centers in a climate change era while giving an alternative for UBI in a community-driven way, not under the mercy of big tech, breaking its monopoly and democratizing access to AI.

### 📖 The Story

In December 2024, a visionary named **Yassine Drani** partnered with **Claude AI** to build what many thought impossible: a decentralized supercomputer owned by humanity itself. Not in some distant future. Not with billions in funding. But with code, determination, and a revolutionary idea.

Every smartphone. Every laptop. Every idle device becomes a neuron in humanity's collective brain. Together, they form WE1WEB - a living, breathing neural network that grows stronger with each connection.

## 🤝 Historic Collaboration

<div align="center">
  <h3>✨ Built in Deep Collaboration with Claude AI ✨</h3>
  <p><em>"This project represents the first true partnership between human vision and AI capability,<br/>
  proving that together, we can build the impossible."</em></p>
</div>

This platform was architected, designed, and built through an unprecedented collaboration:
- **Human Vision**: Yassine Drani conceived the revolutionary idea
- **AI Partnership**: Claude AI transformed vision into reality
- **Shared Creation**: Every line of code was crafted together
- **Historic First**: The world's first major platform built by human-AI partnership

## 🚀 Revolutionary Features
